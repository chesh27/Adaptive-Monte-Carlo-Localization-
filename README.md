# Adaptive-Monte-Carlo-Localization-
Two different mobile robot models are described and evaluated for performance in a simulated environment. Both simulations are run using Gazebo and RViz. The robots use Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization and the move-base plug in for navigation to successfully arrive at a goal that was either pre-determined or user-defined in real time.
